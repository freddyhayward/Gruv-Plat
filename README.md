#### Build dependency
- `glib2` on Arch Linux

Installation
------------
For **Arch Linux**, the [AUR package](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/flatplat-theme) maintained by @cthbleachbit is available.

```sh
sudo yaourt -S flatplat-theme
```

For **Fedora** or **EPEL**, the [Copr repository](https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/tcg/themes/) maintained by @LaurentTreguier is available.

```sh
sudo dnf copr enable tcg/themes
sudo dnf install Flat-Plat-theme
```

#### Manual Installation
Run the following commands in the terminal.

```sh
cd /tmp && curl -sL https://github.com/nana-4/Flat-Plat/archive/v20170917.tar.gz | tar xz
cd Flat-Plat-20170917
sudo ./install.sh
```

#### Manual Uninstallation
Delete the installed directories.

```sh
sudo rm -rf /usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat{,-compact,-dark,-dark-compact,-light,-light-compact}
```

Recommendations
---------------
#### Font
- To properly display the theme, use a font family including `Medium` weight (like [Roboto](https://github.com/google/roboto) or [M+](https://mplus-fonts.osdn.jp)).
- Set the font size to `9.75` (= 13px at 96dpi) or `10.5` (= 14px at 96dpi).

#### Chrome Theme
To use the Chrome theme, open the `chrome` folder on `/usr/share/themes/Flat-Plat<-variant>` and drag and drop the `.crx` files onto the Chrome/Chromium _Extensions_ page.

GDM Theme
---------
You can change the GDM (lock/login screen) theme by replacing the default GNOME Shell theme.  
However, if it fails, the desktop environment may not operate correctly. So please **be careful** if doing this.

#### :warning: Cautions:
- When applying this, other third-party GNOME Shell themes would look broken until you restore to the original theme.
- If GNOME Shell has been updated, it will be restored to the original theme, so you will need to install this again.

### Installation
1. Select a **GTK+** theme to decide which variant to install.
2. Run the following commands to back up and replace the default theme file.

  ```sh
  GTK_THEME=$(gsettings get org.gnome.desktop.interface gtk-theme | sed "s/'//g")
  sudo cp -v --backup /usr/share{/themes/$GTK_THEME,}/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource
  ```

  > **Note:** If you don't want to overwrite the backup on the second and subsequent runs, delete the `--backup` option.

3. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)

### Uninstallation
1. Restore to the original theme from the backup.

  ```sh
  sudo mv -v /usr/share/gnome-shell/gnome-shell-theme.gresource{~,}
  ```

2. Restart GNOME Shell. (If you are running _GNOME on Xorg_, press <kbd>Alt</kbd> + <kbd>F2</kbd> then type `r`.)
